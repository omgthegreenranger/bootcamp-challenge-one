# Bootcamp Challenge 1 - CSS and HTML refactoring

## Task

**Refactoring** existing code (improving it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards or to implement a new technology is a common task for front-end and junior developers. For this particular Challenge, a marketing agency has hired you to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible.

Code for a single-page website was provided with the aim of converting code to semantic HTML and reducing the amount of CSS.

All HTML was adapted to a semantic model, and CSS was reduced from 200 lines to 130 lines - many classes were consolidated and removed where appropriate.

## Usage
